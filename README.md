Try--Tiny--WarnCaught
=====================

Try::Tiny extension to warn exceptions

SYNOPSIS
========
  
  `use Try::Tiny;`
  
  `use Try::Tiny::WarnCaught;`

DESCRIPTION
===========

  This module extends the very useful Try::Tiny's catch functionality to automatically issue a warning containing the caught exception.

  While it may be useful for the stated purpose, its main strength is as
an illustration of how to hook into the Try::Tiny behaviour.
